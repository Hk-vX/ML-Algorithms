# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks exploring various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The models were trained using built-in datasets from scikit-learn, with necessary preprocessing applied before training.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Random Forest & Decision Tree  
- Linear Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- K-Means Clustering  

## Notebook Structure
- **Dataset Loading** – Using built-in datasets from `sklearn.datasets`  
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables  
- **Model Training** – Implementing ML algorithms with `sklearn`  
- **Performance Evaluation** – Assessing models using accuracy, RMSE, precision, recall, and confusion matrices  
- **Analysis & Insights** – Understanding model behavior and areas for improvement
